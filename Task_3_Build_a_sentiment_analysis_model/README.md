# Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Reviews using NLTK
  Welcome to the official GitHub repository for my Sentiment Analysis project using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)! This project focuses on understanding and classifying movie reviews as either positive or negative based on the sentiment expressed in the text.

# Project Overview
  For this project, I used the IMDB dataset from Kaggle, which contains 50,000 movie reviews. The goal was to build a model that could accurately predict whether a review was positive or negative.

# Key Features
   Data Exploration:
I began by exploring the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics. This helped guide the overall approach to cleaning and modeling the data.

   Text Preprocessing:
I cleaned the text data by removing special characters, converting everything to lowercase, and filtering out stopwords to ensure the input was as clean as possible.

   Tokenization & Feature Engineering:
Using NLTK, I tokenized the text and extracted meaningful features to help our model understand and learn from the data.

   Sentiment Classification:
I trained machine learning models to classify the reviews. In testing, I found that ensemble methods performed particularly well for this task.

   Performance Evaluation:
I evaluated the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. I also visualized the results using Seaborn for the confusion matrix and analyzed which features had the most impact on the predictions.

```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook Notebook.ipynb (or notebook.pdf) to access the full code and documentation.

4. Run each cell to follow the sentiment analysis workflow step by step.

# Conclusion 
  This sentiment analysis project showcases the power of natural language processing using the NLTK library to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. By leveraging real-world data, applying effective preprocessing techniques, and evaluating machine learning models, the project demonstrates a complete pipeline for solving text classification problems.
