## âœ… Completed Tasks

### ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Basic Search Algorithms (BFS & DFS)

In this task, I implemented two fundamental search algorithms in Artificial Intelligence:

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** An algorithm that explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving to the next level.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** An algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

These algorithms were applied to a sample graph to demonstrate how state-space traversal works in problem-solving environments.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Sentiment Analysis using NLTK

This task focused on building a basic **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** model:

- Used the **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)** to analyze textual data.
- Trained a sentiment analysis classifier using labeled movie reviews (positive/negative).
- Implemented data preprocessing steps like tokenization and feature extraction.
- Evaluated the model's accuracy in classifying unseen reviews.

This task demonstrated the application of machine learning in understanding human language.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 4: Digit Recognition using Keras and MNIST

In this task, I created a simple **neural network model** using **Keras** to recognize handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**:

- Built a feedforward neural network using dense layers and ReLU/softmax activations.
- Trained the model on 60,000 handwritten digit images.
- Achieved high accuracy on the 10,000-image test set.
- Included visualization of predictions to showcase model performance.

This task helped reinforce concepts of deep learning, model evaluation, and computer vision.
